# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn
about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **Localhost**
  * [0-localhost](./0-localhost): Text file that answers the following question:
  * What is `localhost`?
    1. A hostname that means this IP
    2. A hostname that means this computer
    3. An IP attached to a computer

* **Show attached IPs**
  * [1-show_attached_IPs](./1-show_attached_IPs): Bash script that displays all active IPv4
  IP's on the machine.

* **Port listening on localhost**
  * [100-port_listening_on_localhost](./100-port_listening_on_localhost): Bash script that
  listens on port `98` on `localhost`.
